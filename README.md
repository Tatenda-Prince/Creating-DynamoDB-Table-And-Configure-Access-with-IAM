# Creating-DynamoDB-Table-And-Configure-Access-with-IAM

# Intro
In this project, I will show you how to be a Football Manager, by going through the steps to create a "Chelsea FC starting line up" Amazon Dynamo DB table, populate the table with Chelsea's best players and use AWS IAM to demonstrate the principles of least privilege by allowing read-only access to our table using AWS CLI from EC2 Instance.
